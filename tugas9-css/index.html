             There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
             the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
             humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
             If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
             there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All
             the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
             chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
             Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with
             a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which
             looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
             from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

             Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
             has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
             it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
             Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
             Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
             through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
             undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
             1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
             Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
             theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
             of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
             section 1.10.32.
